      //SYNTHAX
      //the technical definition of synthax "is the structure of statements in a computer language"
      //the process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging

      //Arithmetic
      console.log(2 + 3); //5 addition
      console.log(2 - 3); //-1 subraction
      console.log(2 * 3); //6 multiplication
      console.log(3 % 2); //1 remainder
      console.log(2 ** 3); //8 exponentiation i.e 2*2*2 = 8
      console.log(7 / 2); //3.5  division

      //when linking multiple external js file, your "main.js" should be below all other script. i.e it should come out last. i.e

      //DATA TYPES
      //Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables. In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types

      //Numbers
      //integers (positive, zero or negative value) e.g 1,2,3,0,-3,-9 e.t.c
      //float (Decimal value) e.g 1.0, -3.9, 8.9, 10.0

      /*
      String: A collection of one or more characters between single quote, double quote and backtick
      'belove'
      'javascript is the language for the web'
      'it is good to be alive'

      Boolean: This is either true or false

      Undefined: if we defined a value to a variable it is undefined, and if a function is not returning anything it returns undefined.
      let name;
      console.log(name)

      NUll: it means an empty value. and it means be assign i.e we intentionally assigned it to null
      i.e
      let name = null
      
      to check the datatype of a certain variable we must use typeOf
      console.log(typeOf 'Joshua') = string
      console.log(typeOf 5) = numbeer
      console.log(typeOf null) = object.. tt is an object because null represent the intentional absense of any object value i.e it point to no object
      console.log(typeOf true) = boolean
      console.log(typeOf undefined) = undefined

      VARIABLES;
      they are used to store data in a memory location. when a variable is assigned to a value(data), the memory location will be filled with that data.
      "let nameOfVariable = value".
      i.e value is stored in nameOfVariable.
      */
      //Declaring your variables in a single line. it will be separated by a comma.
      let name = "joshua",
        surname = "onwuemene",
        country = "Nigeria";

      //SYMBOL: IS also a data type. A unique value that can be generated by symbol constructor
